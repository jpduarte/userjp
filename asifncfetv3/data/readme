Please find the data for Lg=90 nm PMOS.  In the .m file, use lines 8-10  to plot the ID-VG at different VD. 

The physical dimensions are as follows: 

Module:  NC
Gate length Lg= 90 nm
Fin Width W= 40 nm
# of Fins N=200

The fin height and the oxide thickness is unknown as far as I know. The fin height should be around 25 nm and the EOT should be ~1 nm or less
